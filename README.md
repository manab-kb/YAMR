# YET ANOTHER MAP REDUCE 
A project made for Big Data Sem -5

We are trying to replicate map-reduce framework.

THE PROJECT CONSISTS OF

A multi-node environment consisting of a master node and multiple worker nodes.
A client program that communicates with the nodes based on the types of operations requested by the user. The operations it can perform are:
WRITE: Given an input file, split it into multiple partitions and store it across multiple worker nodes.
READ: Given a file name, read the different partitions from different workers and display it to the user.
MAP-REDUCE - Given an input file, a mapper file and a reducer file, execute a MapReduce Job on the cluster
